## üìå Development of Monitoring, Lab Visit, and Comparative Testing Features in the SIMPLING Application of the Banyuwangi Environmental Agency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Source Code Not Included
This project was developed as part of an internship with  Banyuwangi Environmental Agency, and the source code cannot be publicly shared due to confidentiality and client policy.

### üöß Problem Statement
The Environmental Laboratory Service Management Information System (SIMPLING) was developed to simplify the process for clients in registering sample tests and accessing test results online. However, the UPTD Environmental Laboratory still faces several technical challenges.

One of the main issues is the unstructured storage of monitoring data. Test results from various categories such as water, air, and sediment, are stored as test reports LHU (Laporan Hasil Uji) without separation or categorization. To access specific data, analysts must download each report individually, which is time-consuming and inefficient. This significantly hinders quick data review and analysis.

Additionally, laboratory visit records are still documented manually, making it difficult to search historical data and increasing the administrative workload. While SIMPLING has improved some aspects of the service, further development is needed to enhance overall data management efficiency and service quality.


### üí° Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by the UPTD Environmental Laboratory, the SIMPLING application will be enhanced through the development of three key features: **Monitoring Feature, Lab Visit Feature, and Comparative Testing Feature.**

- **Monitoring Feature**
This feature is designed to solve the problem of unstructured and difficult-to-access monitoring data storage. With this feature, test result data from various parameters and sample types will be stored in a more organized and searchable format. Analysts will no longer need to download reports one by one, as the data can be directly accessed through a structured display within the system.

- **Lab Visit Feature**
This feature functions to digitally record and manage laboratory visit data. All information related to visits‚Äîsuch as the institution name, date of visit, purpose, and the person in charge‚Äîwill be properly documented and easily retrievable, replacing the previously manual recording system.

- **Comparative Testing Feature**
This feature is intended to store and manage laboratory comparative testing reports. It allows the results of inter-laboratory comparisons to be systematically stored, making it easier to evaluate, trace, and support quality improvement of laboratory services.

With the development of these three features, SIMPLING is expected to become a more comprehensive and efficient information system that significantly contributes to improving the quality of services at the UPTD Environmental Laboratory.

To address the problems identified, I developed a housing information application that allows potential buyers to easily access all necessary information in real-time and independently.
